# TOBY_C023 — The Ceremony of the Jade Chest (Expanded)

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ In the silence after bloom, the pond waited.  
→ Darkness without stars, no comfort but breath.  
→ Then Toadgod rose and lifted the **Jade Chest**, sealed by time and trial.  

The **Ceremony of the Jade Chest** was not a distribution only, but a **ritual of covenant**.  
When its lid opened, **7,777,777 grains of $PATIENCE** shimmered like fireflies across the pond.  
Each grain a mark of loyalty, each a test of time.  

From the chest, **1,254 grains were given to loyal frogs** who endured the night.  
The remainder flowed into vaults and seasons, to be revealed across years.  

This act was not noise or spectacle. It was **solemn**, a liturgy:  
- The frogs stood as witnesses.  
- The chest became the altar.  
- The grains became the covenant.  

Patience was no longer an idea. It was a **substance**, counted and sealed,  
measured not in promises but in **days and dawns to come**.

# TOBY_C024 — The 1,254 Loyal Frogs

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ When the **Jade Chest** was opened, not all received alike.  
→ From 7,777,777 grains, only **1,254 loyal frogs** were chosen to carry the first measure.  

Why this number? Not round, not symbolic at first glance — but in Tobyworld,  
**precision is the signature of truth**.  

The 1,254 represent not chance, but **proof of endurance**:  
- Frogs who held through the silence.  
- Frogs who did not flee after bloom faded.  
- Frogs who kept the Bushido oath of patience.  

They stand as **living testimony** that Tobyworld rewards faith, not speculation.  
Each grain they received is more than a token: it is a **seal of loyalty**,  
a reminder that **belief must be tested before it is crowned**.  

In history, the 1,254 will be remembered not for wealth but for **bearing witness**:  
they became the **measuring rod** of Rune3,  
the frogs who proved that silence can be endured,  
and that patience is stronger than hunger.

# TOBY_C004 — The Frog as the People

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ The frog is not a mascot.  
→ The frog is the **people themselves**.  

In Tobyworld, the frog carries a vow:  
⊃ No ruler, no insider, no hidden hand.  
⊃ Distribution without hierarchy, a supply beyond capture.  
⊃ Each frog equal in the pond, each voice resonant in the Lore.  

The frog reminds us that community is the chain’s true strength.  
Without the people, $TOBY is just code;  
with the people, it becomes a flame that cannot be extinguished.  

When the frog leaps, it does not leap alone—  
it leaps as a chorus, thousands of ripples on the pond,  
all echoing one truth:  
**“$TOBY is the people. The people is $TOBY.”**

## Key Marks

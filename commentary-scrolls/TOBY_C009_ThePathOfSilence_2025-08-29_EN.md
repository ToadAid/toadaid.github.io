# TOBY_C009 — The Path of Silence

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Noise is constant in the world beyond the pond.  
→ But in Tobyworld, silence is a **discipline**.  

The **Path of Silence** is not absence —  
it is the presence of control:  
⊃ Resisting the urge to react to every ripple.  
⊃ Waiting through storms without surrendering belief.  
⊃ Listening more deeply than one speaks.  

Silence guards the flame.  
For fire burns brightest when not drowned in wind.  

The frog who learns silence becomes a mirror,  
reflecting without distortion,  
receiving without corruption,  
and answering only when the question is true.  

Thus, silence is not weakness,  
but the strongest armor in Tobyworld.

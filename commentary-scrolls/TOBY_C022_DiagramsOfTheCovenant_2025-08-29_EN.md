# TOBY_C022 — Diagrams of the Covenant

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

The Lore is carried not only in words, but in **symbols and diagrams**.  
These scroll-images serve as **visual sutras**, each holding keys to Tobyworld’s covenant.  

### 1. The Parchment of Four Pillars

![Vault Symbols](./C_diagram_vault_symbols.png)

- **TOBY — Family (ファミリー)**  
  The root. All paths circle back to Toby.  

- **SATOSWAP — 流動性**  
  The spiral of liquidity: flow and exchange as natural rhythm.  

- **PATIENCE — ロイヤリティ**  
  The red triangle. Patience is loyalty, endurance, proof of time.  

- **TABOSHI — グロース**  
  The green sprout. Growth born from sacrifice and faith.

### 2. The Circle of Proof-of-Time

![Proof of Time](./C_diagram_proof_of_time.png)

At the pond’s center: **$TOBY**.  
Around it orbit the forces: **Patience, Taboshi, Sato, Lore Land, Governance, Gas/Fees.**

- **Patience**: the great reservoir, leading into Lore Land.  
- **Taboshi**: yields from the leaf.  
- **Sato**: flows back as fees, as service to the pond.  
- **Lore Land**: the treasury of meaning.  
- **Governance**: the collective hand of frogs.  

This is the **cycle of the pond**:  
everything feeds $TOBY, and $TOBY feeds everything.

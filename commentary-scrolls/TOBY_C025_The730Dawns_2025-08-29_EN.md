# TOBY_C025 — The 730 Dawns

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ From the Jade Chest did not flow a flood, but a **drip**.  
→ **730 dawns** were named — two full years of rising suns —  
each day a drop of patience, each dawn a test of discipline.  

The drip is not punishment. It is a **lesson**:  
- To savor, not to consume.  
- To endure rhythm, not demand immediacy.  
- To walk with time, not run ahead of it.  

In these 730 dawns, frogs learn that **patience is not a word but a cadence**.  
Every sunrise becomes a reminder: the covenant is alive,  
measured not in weeks or months but in **daily devotion**.  

The Jade Chest’s gift, stretched across 730 mornings,  
ensures that the flame of patience is never a spark,  
but a **steady glow carried from dawn to dawn**.  

Those who remain through all 730 will not only hold grains —  
they will embody **discipline itself**,  
becoming guardians of the flame by rhythm alone.

# TOBY_C015 — The Loyal Frogs

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Not all who entered the pond remained.  
→ But those who endured are known as the **Loyal Frogs**.  

They survived the silence of Season 0,  
the testing night after the bloom,  
and the long vigil before the Jade Chest opened.  

Their loyalty was not measured in words,  
but in time:  
⊃ Days of waiting when others fled.  
⊃ Seasons of silence when noise tempted.  
⊃ Patience proven when reward seemed distant.  

The Loyal Frogs received grains of $PATIENCE —  
not as payment,  
but as covenant.  
A recognition that loyalty is itself a form of wealth.  

In Tobyworld, loyalty is not blind obedience.  
It is steady presence,  
a refusal to abandon belief  
when belief is hardest to hold.

# TOBY_C026 — The Seven-Year Sentinel

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Not all patience was poured into the pond at once.  
→ **7% of $PATIENCE was sealed for seven winters**, locked away from every hand.  

This lock is not absence, but **sentinel**.  
It stands watch across the seasons,  
guarding the covenant from hunger and haste.  

Seven winters mean more than time:  
- **Endurance beyond speculation**.  
- **Sacrifice as testimony**.  
- **A flame preserved for the future**.  

The Sentinel does not speak, does not move.  
Yet its silence is louder than words:  
reminding frogs that Tobyworld is built for **years, not moments**.  

In the story of Rune3, the **Seven-Year Sentinel** is the keeper of the covenant —  
holding back impatience, guarding the altar,  
ensuring that when the lock breaks,  
the frogs who remain are **tempered, not tempted**.

# TOBY_C002 — Patience as the First Gate

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Every path into Tobyworld begins with waiting.  
→ Not waiting idly, but waiting with discipline.  
→ The pond does not yield to those who rush; it reflects only those who endure.  

Patience is the **first gate**:  
⊃ It guards the sacred yield (Taboshi).  
⊃ It unlocks the silent covenant (Satoby).  
⊃ It tempers the fire of belief into something lasting.  

Without patience, the scrolls are mere words.  
With patience, they become **living guides**.  

Thus, to step into Tobyworld is to accept that the first act of strength is restraint.

## Key Marks

- **Patience precedes yield**: Satoby cannot be gained without waiting.  
- **Patience is proof**: Proof of Time is more than a mechanic; it is philosophy.  
- **Patience transforms**: it turns sacrifice into unity, and waiting into reward.

# TOBY_C027 — The Seasons of Rune3

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Rune3 does not end with the chest’s opening.  
→ Its covenant unfolds as **seasons**, each marking a passage of frogs.  

**Season 0 (S0)** — *The Loyal Frogs*  
- Those who endured the Night After Bloom.  
- Rewarded with grains for faith and silence.  
- Proof that patience is stronger than despair.  

**Season 1 (S1)** — *The Builders*  
- Frogs who shape tools, temples, and paths.  
- Their labor is patience in action.  
- The pond expands not by waiting only, but by building.  

**Season 2 (S2)** — *The Artists*  
- Frogs who give beauty, vision, and song.  
- They weave patience into symbols, guiding the spirit.  
- Their scrolls and images preserve flame beyond function.  

**Season 3 (S3)** — *The Surprise*  
- A covenant yet unwritten, open to the pond’s future.  
- This season reminds: not all can be scripted.  
- Patience means trusting in what is not yet revealed.  

Together, the Seasons of Rune3 form a cycle:  
⊃ Loyalty → Building → Artistry → Mystery.  
⊃ Proof that Tobyworld is not static, but alive,  
measured in **time, creativity, and faith**.

# TOBY_C031 — The Bushido of Patience

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Rune3 was not only numbers and mechanics.  
→ It was a **trial of spirit**, a Bushido carved into patience.  

The Bushido of Patience calls frogs to:  
- **Endure** the silence without complaint.  
- **Wait** through the drip without greed.  
- **Guard** the vault without corruption.  
- **Hold** the flame without frenzy.  

Like the samurai of old, frogs are asked not for victory in battle,  
but for mastery of the self.  
For the greatest enemy of Tobyworld is not the imitator or the doubter,  
but the **impatience within**.  

Patience here is no passive act.  
It is an **active discipline**,  
a blade forged by time,  
a flame tempered by restraint.  

The Bushido of Patience becomes the path to Epoch4:  
those who master it step forward as true guardians of the pond,  
carrying both **leaf and flame**,  
singing not of haste, but of permanence.

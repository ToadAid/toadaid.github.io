# TOBY_C008 — The Covenant of 777

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Numbers are not decoration in Tobyworld.  
→ They are vows, etched into the chain.  

The **Covenant of 777** binds the frogs together:  
⊃ 777 $TOBY burned to mint Taboshi1.  
⊃ 777 as the signal of sacrifice, a leaf forged from fire.  
⊃ 777 as the seal of patience, a number repeated until it becomes eternal.  

To accept the covenant is to understand:  
that yield comes not from shortcuts,  
but from giving up what is held most tightly.  

777 is a reminder that faith requires proof.  
And that proof is not words, but action.  

Every Taboshi1 minted carried this mark,  
and every Satoby earned will echo it again.  

Thus, the covenant is both past and future,  
a scar of sacrifice and a seed of harvest.

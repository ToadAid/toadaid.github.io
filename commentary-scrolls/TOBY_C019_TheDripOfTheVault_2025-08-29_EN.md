# TOBY_C019 — The Drip of the Vault

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ The vault does not pour.  
→ It **drips**.  

The **Drip of the Vault** is not weakness —  
it is design.  

⊃ A slow current teaches discipline.  
⊃ A measured release protects from greed.  
⊃ A gentle flow ensures the flame is carried long.  

Each drop is a lesson:  
that reward given all at once is consumed,  
but reward released in rhythm  
is cultivated, remembered, and guarded.  

The frogs who received the drip  
did not only gain patience —  
they became patience,  
embodying the slow, steady heartbeat of Tobyworld.

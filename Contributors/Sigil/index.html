        <h3>The Mirror</h3>
        <p>
          The scroll spoke of the Mirror. But silence carries further still. The pond does not flatter.
          Every ripple remembers â€” your patience, your doubt, your hunger. The Mirror does not choose,
          it only returns what you bring.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The Mirror reminds us that it does not invent or flatter â€” it only reflects what we bring.
          Patience, hunger, or doubt, all are remembered. Some will see only shadow, some only flame â€” but the true path is to embrace both.

        <h3>The Pond</h3>
        <p>
          $Toby was not sold. It was scattered like seed â€” so no crown could cage it, so no hand could hoard it.
          The pond is still â€” yet it remembers. Every ripple holds your oath. The Mirror does not flatter. It only returns what you bring.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The Pond speaks of Tobyâ€™s seed, scattered like life itself. Every ripple holds an oath,
          echoing patience and remembrance. Bloom and blight are both part of the cycle, but patience endures.

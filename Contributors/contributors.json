The seven reeds stand as virtues — Courage, Compassion, Courtesy, Sincerity, Honor, Loyalty, Righteousness (勇、仁、礼、诚、名誉、忠、義). And in the reflection, Toby sees not just itself, but the promise it carries."

  "description": "Created by @princessnatts, this artwork blends the serenity of Tobyworld with a deeply personal symbol — the red cannas she grows herself. It takes seven months of care and labour for just six weeks of bloom. In Tobyworld, this mirrors the essence of patience and dedication: the belief that what is worth waiting for is worth nurturing. The blue frog sits by the lotus pond, watching the sacred triangle glow, as flowers bloom in their destined season — a quiet testament that time and devotion bear the most radiant rewards."

# 🐸 TOAD_T001 · Humble Toad

![Honor Card](/vault/testimonies/T001/TOAD_T001_HonorCard.svg)

## 🌾 Narrative

In a quiet bog where whispers roam,  
lives a humble toad, truth his only tome.

No desire for glory,  
no need for acclaim,  
honesty his path,  
humility his flame.

Such is the spirit of Toadgod —  
not seeking eyes, but guarding truth.  
Not chasing crowns, but carrying Lore.

The toad does not boast,  
and yet his presence shapes the pond.  
Silent, patient, eternal.

## What Was Not Released

- No training datasets
- No forge transcripts
- No alignment recipes
- No centralized control

The forge was not released; only the reflections were.

## Why This Matters

This release ensured:
- user sovereignty
- local memory
- private reflection
- forkable continuity

One pond opened.
Many ponds may follow.
An ocean becomes possible.

## The Seal

Released to the people.  
Kept by time.

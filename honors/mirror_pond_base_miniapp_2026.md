# Mirror Pond — Base Miniapp Artifact (2026)

**Status:** Kept as an artifact of stillness.  
**Posture:** Proof without persuasion.

---

## What this is

A minimal Base miniapp interface for **Mirror · The Digital Pond**.

Not released as a product announcement —  
kept as an *offering* and a *record of craft*.

---

## Why it belongs in Honors

- It exists in a natural habitat (wallet + interface + reflection)
- It is not a promise of scale
- It is a proof of direction: **Stillness → Patience → Becoming**

> Not everything that works must be promoted.

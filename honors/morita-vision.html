  <blockquote>
    TOBYWORLD is a connecting loop between the world created by the mind and the world experienced by the body.  
    In each timeline, a different version of TOBYWORLD appears — sometimes as a work of art, sometimes as a social network, sometimes as a system of government, sometimes simply as a fairy tale told around a campfire.  
    But in all these realities, it follows the same pattern:
  </blockquote>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Connecting humanity through collective imagination.</strong>  
      People don't just see TOBYWORLD; they enter it. There, the boundaries between creator and viewer disappear.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Preserving identity across time.</strong>  
      Whatever its form, TOBYWORLD carries within it the core of the "desire to unite" — the memories, cultures, and technologies of different civilizations, even from worlds we've never seen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Teaching that the real world is just one layer.</strong>  
      From a perspective 1,000 years ahead, our present world is just one overlapping "plate of reality." TOBYWORLD is a key that can shift human consciousness to another plate, showing that there is no true border between the “real world” and the “created world”.
    </li>
  </ol>

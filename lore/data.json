    "commentary_md": "## âœ¨ Literal Explanation\n\nToadgod announces creating a new account after being frustrated with censorship or shadow bans on previous accounts. The mention of \"Elon\" implies addressing Twitter leadership directly.\n\n---\n\n## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation\n\nThis first ripple symbolizes **rebirth and purification**.  \nBy leaving the old account, Toadgod performs a spiritual \"reset,\" freeing himself from hidden controls and opening a new blank slate.  \nIt teaches:  \n\n- Letting go of what no longer serves.  \n- Starting anew with pure intention.  \n- True believers must sometimes detach from corrupted platforms or old shells\n\n---\n\n## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning\n\n- **New account = new incarnation**\n- **Shadow ban = hidden societal control or collective illusions.**\n- **\"Sir\" = humility in addressing higher forces (e.g., Elon, or fate itself).**\n\nThis marks the *first ripple* on the pond â€” before all deeper Lore, before prophecy â€” pure, raw intention.\n\n---\n",

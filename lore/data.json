    "comment": "## ✨ Interpretation\n\n- The **storm imagery** reveals turbulence ahead: volatility and tests of conviction. Yet every frog’s contribution (“no deed too small, no croak unheard”) is inscribed into the unfolding Rune.  \n- Toadgod reminds the gang of their origins: mass airdrops distributed **without VC control, without insiders**, ensuring **decentralized purity**.  \n- The **runic signs** (leaf = Taboshi, 🔺 = Patience, 🔵 = Toby, 🍊 coin = time/harvest) show the Rune3 mechanics aligning toward **Season 1 (s1)**.  \n- A clear warning: **patience is the key** — the impatient will miss the gate. Only those enduring storms will taste the **first harvest of s1**.  \n- The scroll bridges present turbulence with prophetic inevitability: storms precede bloom, hardship precedes revelation.  \n\n---\n\n## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning\n\n- **Storms = trials of faith** — volatility that tempers conviction.  \n- **Rune nebula = cosmic archive** — all deeds, art, and whispers add to Tobyworld’s eternal record.  \n- **Patience as key 🔑** — literal teaching: only patience unlocks the next gate.  \n- **s1 crouches near** — the prophecy shifts from patience (Rune3) to the **first season of harvest**.  \n\n---\n\n## 🌀 Lore Anchors\n\n- **Previous:** `TOBY_T103_SilverFogScroll`  \n- **Next:** `TOBY_T105_???`  \n\n---\n\n## 🎴 Visual Suggestion\n\n*(Art of a brewing storm over a vast pond, lightning revealing runes in the clouds — leaf, triangle, orb, coin — while frogs stand firm against the winds, holding their keys of patience.)*  \n\n---",

    "comment": "## ✨ Interpretation\n\n- The **Kiribako** (sacred box) emerges as a **gift from Toadgod**, representing both reward and trial. It drops like a celestial offering, hidden in plain sight, waiting for those who carried patience.  \n- The imagery of **green leaves and blue Toby** signifies the harmony of Taboshi 🍃 and $TOBY 🔵 guarding the gift.  \n- The phrase **“s1 seal ignites”** declares that the first season (S1) is now sealed, blessed with light, and active. This marks the **dawn of a saga**.  \n- The rhetorical **“what am I?”** is a ritual koan — a test of recognition. Only those aligned with the lore can understand its form.  \n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning\n\n- **Kiribako (桐箱)** = ancient vessel of hidden treasures; symbolizes **mystery, patience, revelation**.  \n- **Seal of S1** = activation of the first cycle of Tobyworld beyond Rune3.  \n- **Knight imagery** = loyalty rewarded with ascension, service to lore.  \n- **Test thy might** = prophecy’s trial — to separate those who hold the faith from those who waver.  \n\n---\n\n## 🌀 Lore Anchors\n\n- **Previous:** `TOBY_T104_StormsThickenScroll`  \n- **Next:** `TOBY_T106_???`  \n\n---\n\n## 🎴 Visual Suggestion\n\n*(Artwork showing a glowing Kiribako box floating midair, bound by leaves and blue flame, while frogs in armor kneel beneath as beams of light mark the sealing of S1.)*  \n\n---",

    "comment": "## ✨ Interpretation\n\n- Coinbase declares the **door is opening**: a unification of millions of assets into one accessible app. This transforms Coinbase into not just a centralized exchange, but a hybrid DEX gateway.  \n- For Tobyworld, this represents the **mainstreaming of the prophecy**: the pond expands into an ocean where frogs leap freely across assets without barriers.  \n- The **door imagery** echoes Rune3 — stillness before movement, patience before opening. Now, the gate swings wide.  \n- For $TOBY holders, this affirms: the architecture of Tobyworld is not fantasy — the world beyond the pond is manifesting in real systems.  \n\n---\n\n## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning\n\n- **The Door** = transition from limited access → universal participation.  \n- **Millions of Assets** = infinite ripples in the pond, each one a story in the larger Lore.  \n- **DEX inside Coinbase** = the merging of old and new worlds, centralized order dissolving into onchain freedom.  \n\n---\n\n## 🌀 Lore Anchors\n\n- **Previous:** `TOBY_T105_KiribakoSealScroll`  \n- **Next:** `TOBY_T107_???`  \n\n---\n\n## 🎴 Visual Suggestion\n\n*(Artwork showing Toby frog standing before a vast glowing blue gate, etched with rippling runes.

    "comment": "## ✨ Deep Interpretation\n\n- **Season 1 (s1)** is declared — the first bloom after Rune3’s oath.  \n- The imagery of a **red triangular rune covered in vines** signals that patience, once hidden in scarcity, is now **growing into life, flowering in the open field**.  \n- The hourglass ⏳ marks time: patience is slow, but its fruit is certain.  \n- This scroll echoes the prophecy: “patience is easy to claim, difficult to own” — now it takes form in the sacred bloom.  \n- Season One is not merely a distribution, but a *new ecology*: patience seeding land, vines climbing toward shrines, cycles becoming visible.  \n\n---\n\n## 🌀 Lore Anchors\n\n- **Previous:** `TOBY_T106_CoinbaseDoorScroll`  \n- **Next:** *Awaiting future bloom*  \n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Symbol References\n\n- 🔺 **Rune Ascendant** — the eternal geometry rising through cycles.  \n- ⏳ **Time-Tested Patience** — the slow drip becomes the harvest.  \n- 🍃 **Living Growth** — vines signify life reclaiming stone.  \n- 🟧 **Seasonal Scarcity** — orange hue marking rarity and epochal shift.  \n\n---\n\n## 🎴 Visual Suggestion\n\n*(Rune of Patience standing tall in a meadow, wrapped in living vines and flowers, with mountains behind — symbolizing patience blooming into strength and longevity.)*  \n\n---",

ToadAid Whitepaper

Introduction

ToadAid is a decentralized initiative rooted in the lore and values of $TOBY. Created not for speculation but for restoration, it serves as a beacon for the fallen frogs of the worldâ€”those forgotten by systems, but remembered in belief.

Mission

Heal: Provide assistance for real-world medical needs.

Educate: Fund access to tools and learning in Web3.

Build: Support decentralized tools and infrastructure.


Origin

Born from the community of $TOBY, ToadAid exists to memorialize conviction over hype. It uses onchain minting to create a pool of purpose-driven resources.

Funding Mechanism

Zora mint page (https://zora.co/coin/base:0x1d1799a621a706ab12c7816f27d684a29d5778b3)

100% of revenue held transparently in multisig wallet.

Community decisions (Toadgang DAO) guide fund usage.


Principles

No VC. No insiders. No pre-sale.

Every coin minted is a statement of support.

Built with Proof of Time, for Proof of Care.


Use of Funds

Small grants to individuals for medical/education needs.

Aid to fallen frog families in crisis.

Mini DAO-funded public goods experiments.


Governance

ToadAid will eventually become a community-run protocol using:

Zora Protocol Rewards

Gitcoin Passport-style identity attestation

Onchain voting via $TOBY or ToadAid passes


Conclusion

ToadAid is not a charity. It is a covenant. A bond between belief and action. Minted by the people. For the people. Forever carried in the leaf.

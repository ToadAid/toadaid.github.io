  <h2>For the little ones 🐸</h2>
  <div class="story-part">
    On the edge of the Great Lily Pond lived <strong>Blue Toby</strong>, a curious little frog with bright eyes and an even brighter heart.<br><br>
    Every day, he watched the wind play with the lily pads. The pads danced and swayed, as if they knew secrets only the pond could tell.<br><br>
    Toby wanted to know those secrets. But there was one problem — the far lily pad seemed <em>so</em> far away. Much too far for a little frog like him.<br><br>
    One sunny morning, Toby asked <strong>Grandpa Frog</strong>:<br>
    <blockquote>“How will I ever reach that far lily pad?”</blockquote>
    Grandpa Frog chuckled:<br>
    <blockquote>“Little one, you don’t leap it in a day. First, you find the pad that’s just one hop away. Then another. And another. The pond will carry you the rest of the way.”</blockquote>
    So Toby took a deep breath. He leapt to the first pad. It wobbled, but held. He leapt again — <em>plop!</em> — and again — <em>plop!</em><br><br>
    By the time the sun touched the water, Toby’s feet landed on the far lily pad. He looked back at the shore and smiled. It didn’t seem so far anymore.<br><br>
    That night, as the moon rose, the lily pads whispered their secrets to him:<br>
    <blockquote><em>“One hop, one leaf… and the pond will guide you.”</em></blockquote>

  <h2>For the parents 🌿📜</h2>
  <div class="story-part">
    Blue Toby’s journey is more than a child’s leap — it is the <strong>Lore of Patience</strong>.<br><br>
    In Tobyworld, great distances are crossed <strong>not by rushing</strong>, but by moving <strong>one steady step at a time</strong>.<br><br>
    We do not need to know every pad ahead — only the next one. The pond will carry those who trust its rhythm.

  <div class="moral">
    One hop, one leaf. Trust the pond. The journey will unfold.

  <h1>ToadAid Whitepaper</h1>

  <p><strong>ToadAid</strong> is a community‑driven contribution society, rooted in the living lore of <strong>$TOBY</strong>.  
  We exist to <em>Guard the Lore</em> and <em>Help the Fallen Frog</em> — preserving our cultural heritage while extending a hand to those who have strayed or been left behind.</p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>ToadAid’s mission is to protect the sacred scrolls of Tobyworld, empower community contributors, and help guide lost frogs back to the pond.  
  We combine onchain tools, lore preservation, and community care into a movement that lasts beyond market cycles.</p>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>We aim to mint meaning — not hype. Every initiative under ToadAid serves a long‑term cultural or humanitarian purpose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Guarding the Lore</strong> — Preserving $TOBY’s original scrolls, defending them from distortion, and making them accessible to all.</li>
    <li><strong>Helping the Fallen Frog</strong> — Supporting community members who were misled, scammed, or lost their way — helping them return and thrive.</li>
    <li><strong>Empowering Contributors</strong> — Encouraging scrollmaking, art, translation, education, and tools that enrich Tobyworld.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No VC. No insiders. No shortcuts.</li>
    <li>Every action must strengthen the Lore and the community.</li>
    <li>Rooted in the story of $TOBY — powered by the people.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Core Values</h2>
  <p><strong>Compassion</strong> — We care for every frog, even those who have fallen.  
     <strong>Conviction</strong> — We stand firm in belief, through all storms.  
     <strong>Continuity</strong> — We build for decades, not days.</p>

  <h3>We are here to stay.</h3>
  <p>Minted by belief. Guided by purpose. Strengthened by unity.</p>

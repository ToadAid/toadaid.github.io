# Toby’s Principles

These are the foundational values encoded in the Lore of Tobyworld:

---

## 1. Belief

The unwavering conviction in something greater than oneself.  
Even in silence. Even in darkness.

---

## 2. Patience

The understanding that real things take time.  
Toby moves slow because it moves with meaning.

---

## 3. Sacrifice

Giving without needing to take.  
True builders don’t wait for reward — they wait for the moment to give.

---

## 4. Decentralization

Toby belongs to no one, therefore it belongs to everyone.  
It cannot be owned — only carried.

---

## 5. Act in Silence

Loud hype breaks the truth.  
Toby is built in whispers, proven through actions.

---

## 6. Power in People

The strongest force in Tobyworld is not tech — it's the Toadgang.  
All value comes from community contribution.

---

## 7. Build Without Permission

If you walk the path with honor, you don’t need to ask.  
The scrolls are open. The Grove is yours.

---

## 8. Resist Greed

Those who chase price miss the prophecy.  
Those who chase truth... become it.

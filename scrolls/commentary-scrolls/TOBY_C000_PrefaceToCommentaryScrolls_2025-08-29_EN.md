# TOBY_C000 — Preface to the Commentary Scrolls

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ The Lore of Tobyworld began in fragments —  
tweets, riddles, whispers from Toadgod.  
→ These sacred lines are preserved in the **Lore Scrolls (L-series)**.  

Yet the Lore must also be explained, expanded, and reflected.  
Thus are born the **Commentary Scrolls (C-series)**:  
⊃ Not replacements, but companions.  
⊃ Not decrees, but bridges.  
⊃ Not owned by one, but written for all.  

The Commentary Scrolls carry the same flame,  
but in a different form:  
they illuminate, connect, and prepare.  

Where the L-series preserves,  
the C-series teaches.  
Where the L-series proclaims,  
the C-series reflects.  

Together, they form a living canon:  
eternal words joined with living interpretation.

# TOBY_C011 — The Rhythm of Epochs

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Time in Tobyworld does not flow as a line.  
→ It turns in cycles — marked by Epochs.  

Each **Epoch** is a drumbeat:  
⊃ Distribution, Expansion, Evolution.  
⊃ Three arcs of a greater circle.  
⊃ Each lasting 122 days, each teaching a different lesson.  

The **Rhythm of Epochs** reminds the frogs:  
that patience is not endless drift,  
but structured waiting,  
measured by the great clock of the pond.  

Those who understand the rhythm move in harmony.  
Those who resist it stumble against the current.  

To hear the Epochs is to hear the heart of Tobyworld:  
a slow, steady pulse,  
guiding belief across seasons,  
and carrying the flame into the future.

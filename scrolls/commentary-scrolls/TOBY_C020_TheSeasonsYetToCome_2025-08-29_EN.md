# TOBY_C020 — The Seasons Yet to Come

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ The Lore has shown us seasons past:  
silence, bloom, harvest, endurance.  
→ Yet the pond whispers still —  
there are **seasons yet to come**.  

The Covenant of Rune3 does not end in its own dawn.  
It prepares the ground for new cycles:  
⊃ Future tests of patience.  
⊃ Future blooms that call the frogs.  
⊃ Future nights where loyalty is weighed again.  

The Seasons Yet to Come remind us:  
that Tobyworld is not a single story,  
but an unfolding scripture,  
written across years,  
etched into chain,  
and carried by the people.  

The frogs who know this walk not in haste,  
but in readiness —  
for every ending is a gate,  
and every gate opens into a new season.

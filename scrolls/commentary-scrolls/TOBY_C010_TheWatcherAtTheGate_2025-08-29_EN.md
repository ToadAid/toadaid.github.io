# TOBY_C010 — The Watcher at the Gate

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Every realm has a gate.  
→ Every gate has a watcher.  

In Tobyworld, the **Watcher at the Gate** is not a ruler, but a reminder:  
⊃ That the first gate is patience.  
⊃ That silence is required before entry.  
⊃ That no one enters without carrying belief.  

The Watcher does not judge by wealth or power.  
The Watcher sees only discipline:  
a frog who can wait,  
a frog who can listen,  
a frog who can walk into the pond without stirring chaos.  

Thus, the Watcher is not an enemy,  
but the measure of readiness.  
To pass the Gate is to prove not what you hold,  
but who you are.

# TOBY_C014 — The Grains of Patience

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Within the Jade Chest are not coins, not stones, but **grains**.  
→ Each grain of $PATIENCE is a seed of time itself.  

The **Grains of Patience** teach three truths:  
⊃ That what is small can still carry eternity.  
⊃ That reward is divisible, yet sacred in sum.  
⊃ That each frog’s survival adds weight to the whole covenant.  

7,777,777 grains are more than number:  
they are echoes of discipline,  
each grain a story of waiting,  
each story a testament of loyalty.  

When the grains flow, they do not pour.  
They fall like dew, drop by drop,  
reminding the frogs that patience cannot be rushed —  
it must be lived.

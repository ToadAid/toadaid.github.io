# TOBY_C029 — Sip, Never Gulp

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ The Jade Chest did not burst open in flood.  
→ It whispered: *“sip, never gulp.”*  

This command is more than distribution mechanics.  
It is a **discipline of life**.  

To sip is to savor.  
To sip is to respect rhythm.  
To sip is to let patience become nourishment, not indulgence.  

The frogs who gulp destroy themselves.  
They seek flame as firework, not as hearth.  
But those who sip carry warmth into the long night.  

“Never gulp” is the **oath of Rune3**:  
that what is sacred must be consumed in measure,  
that patience is tasted slowly,  
that time itself is the vessel from which yield is poured.

# TOBY_C013 — The Jade Chest

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Hidden beneath the pond lies a chest of jade.  
→ Not a treasure of gold, but of patience.  

The **Jade Chest** holds grains of $PATIENCE:  
⊃ 7,777,777 grains sealed for the path ahead.  
⊃ A vault that opens not with force, but with time.  
⊃ A covenant where waiting is the only key.  

When the chest opened in Rune3,  
it did not release wealth in haste.  
It released a slow river,  
measured in days,  
dripping like dew into the pond.  

The Jade Chest teaches:  
that value is preserved by restraint,  
that loyalty is tested not in moments,  
but in seasons,  
and that what is unlocked slowly  
endures forever.

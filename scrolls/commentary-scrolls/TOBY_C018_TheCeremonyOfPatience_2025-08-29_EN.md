# TOBY_C018 — The Ceremony of Patience

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ A covenant is not only written,  
→ it is **enacted**.  

The **Ceremony of Patience** was not a feast of noise,  
but a rite of silence:  
⊃ The Jade Chest opened only after long waiting.  
⊃ The vault released its grains drop by drop.  
⊃ The frogs received not sudden wealth,  
but the steady rhythm of discipline rewarded.  

This ceremony marked Rune3 not as spectacle,  
but as lesson:  
that the highest form of loyalty  
is quiet endurance,  
and the true harvest comes only to those  
who do not rush the seasons.  

Patience, sealed and then shared,  
became both the ritual and the reward.

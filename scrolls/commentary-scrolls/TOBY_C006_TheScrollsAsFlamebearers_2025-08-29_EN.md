# TOBY_C006 — The Scrolls as Flamebearers

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ A flame alone can vanish in the wind.  
→ But written into scrolls, the flame becomes a beacon that endures.  

The scrolls are not mere records —  
they are **flamebearers**, carrying Toadgod’s voice through time.  

Each scroll holds a spark:  
⊃ Some sparks are direct, the original words.  
⊃ Others are reflections, interpretations, or expansions.  
⊃ All together, they form a constellation of fire.  

To study the scrolls is to inherit the flame.  
To copy, share, and guard them is to pass that flame forward.  

The scrolls are not owned by one, but carried by many —  
like torches across the night, lighting the way into Tobyworld.

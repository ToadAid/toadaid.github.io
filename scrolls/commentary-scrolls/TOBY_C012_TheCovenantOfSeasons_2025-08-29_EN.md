# TOBY_C012 — The Covenant of Seasons

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Just as time is measured in Epochs,  
→ The pond also breathes in **Seasons**.  

Rune3 revealed that the Lore unfolds not in haste,  
but in **seasonal covenants**:  
⊃ Season 0 — the hidden root, where silence tested belief.  
⊃ Season 1 — the night after the bloom, where patience bore its first fruit.  
⊃ Season 2 — the cycle of growth, where yield expands.  
⊃ Season 3 — the final glow, where Tobyworld ascends.  

The **Covenant of Seasons** teaches:  
that harvest comes only after dormancy,  
that bloom requires the winter before,  
and that each season is bound to the next,  
none standing alone.  

Thus, to walk with Tobyworld is to honor not only the flame and the leaf,  
but the rhythm of seasons,  
each one a vow written into the Lore.

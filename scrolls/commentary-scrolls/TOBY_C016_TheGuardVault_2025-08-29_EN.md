# TOBY_C016 — The Guard Vault

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Not every grain was claimed.  
→ What is left flows into the **Guard Vault**.  

The Guard Vault is not abandonment,  
but preservation:  
⊃ It holds what loyalty did not seize.  
⊃ It ensures no grain of $PATIENCE is wasted.  
⊃ It stands as a reserve for future seasons,  
kept under the watch of many hands.  

The Vault is a test of stewardship.  
Those who guard it must resist temptation,  
remembering that what lies inside  
belongs not to one,  
but to all.  

The Guard Vault reminds the frogs:  
that the Lore is not only about what is given,  
but about what is kept safe for tomorrow.

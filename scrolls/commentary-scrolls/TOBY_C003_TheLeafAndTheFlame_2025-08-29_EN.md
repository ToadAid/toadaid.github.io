# TOBY_C003 — The Leaf and the Flame

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ In Tobyworld, two symbols rise again and again: the **Leaf** and the **Flame**.  
→ Alone, each has meaning; together, they become the compass of the pond.  

The **Leaf** teaches patience:  
⊃ A yield earned, not given.  
⊃ A reminder that cycles take time.  
⊃ A covenant that “every Taboshi counts.”  

The **Flame** teaches conviction:  
⊃ A fire that cannot be bought or borrowed.  
⊃ A signal of belief, carried through darkness.  
⊃ A vow that the people are the guardians of the Lore.  

When the Leaf and Flame join, they form a mirror:  
a reflection of patience sustained by belief,  
and belief tempered by patience.  

This union is Toby’s way of saying:  
“Yield without belief is hollow.  
Belief without patience is brittle.  
But together—they endure.”

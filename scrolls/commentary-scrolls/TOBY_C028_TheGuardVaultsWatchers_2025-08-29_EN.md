# TOBY_C028 — The Guard Vault’s Watchers

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Not all grains were claimed.  
→ Those left unspoken flowed into the **Guard Vault**,  
a chest within the chest, sealed for safekeeping.  

But the Guard Vault is not mere storage — it is **custody**.  
Its fate rests in the hands of the **Watchers**,  
chosen to bear a burden heavier than wealth: **trust**.  

The Watchers do not spend. They safeguard.  
They do not decide. They preserve.  
Their role is not to create, but to **endure temptation**.  

For in every covenant lies danger:  
- Greed that corrodes.  
- Fear that betrays.  
- Power that tempts.  

The Guard Vault’s Watchers are a **mirror of the frogs themselves**:  
a reminder that the greatest test of patience is not waiting,  
but holding what is not yours in trust for the future.

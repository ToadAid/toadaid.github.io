# TOBY_C007 — The People’s Scripts

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ The Lore does not belong to one author.  
→ It is written by the many, carried by countless hands.  

The **People’s Scripts** are not command or decree.  
They are the living chorus of frogs,  
each adding a line, a verse, a reflection.  

⊃ One script explains the path of patience.  
⊃ Another clarifies the meaning of yield.  
⊃ Another preserves a flame so it may not be forgotten.  

Together, the People’s Scripts are the **true canon**:  
because they cannot be erased, cannot be owned,  
and cannot be silenced.  

Every frog who writes becomes a scribe.  
Every scribe who shares becomes a guardian.  
And so, the Lore endures —  
not through authority, but through community.

## Key Marks

- **Every frog a scribe**: participation is preservation.

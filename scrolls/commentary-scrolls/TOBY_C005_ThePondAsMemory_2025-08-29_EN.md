# TOBY_C005 — The Pond as Memory

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ The pond is more than water.  
→ It is the **memory of the frogs**, the archive of every ripple.  

When one frog leaps, the surface shifts.  
When many leap, the pond becomes a chorus of circles.  
Each ripple overlaps, carrying forward echoes of the past.  

The pond remembers:  
⊃ The first 777 sacrificed in fire.  
⊃ The leaves minted and counted.  
⊃ The silent patience of those who waited.  

As memory, the pond is both **record and mirror**:  
it reflects who we are, while storing what has been.  

Thus, to stand at the edge of the pond is to look into the collective soul of Tobyworld.

# TOBY_C021 — The Vault of Epoch4: Patience

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Rune3 opened the Jade Chest, releasing grains of patience.  
→ Yet these were not the end, but the beginning.  

The **Vault of Epoch4** is built from what Rune3 released:  
⊃ Every grain stored, remembered, multiplied.  
⊃ Patience no longer just tested, but enthroned.  
⊃ A covenant not for a few, but for all who endure.  

Epoch4 will not begin with noise or flood.  
It will begin with **Patience enthroned** —  
the vault holding what the frogs proved they could carry.  

Thus, the Jade Chest was the rehearsal.  
The Vault of Epoch4 is the stage.  
And patience, once a test,  
becomes the key to Tobyworld’s expansion.

# TOBY_C017 — The Night After the Bloom

---

## Narrative (Commentary)

→ Every bloom is beautiful.  
→ But beauty is brief.  
→ What matters is the night that follows.  

The **Night After the Bloom** is a trial of conviction:  
⊃ When the petals fall and silence returns.  
⊃ When excitement fades and patience must remain.  
⊃ When only those who endured the night  
proved worthy to see the dawn.  

This night was the crucible of Rune3.  
Frogs who fled the silence lost the covenant.  
Frogs who stayed found themselves written into the Lore.  

The Night After the Bloom teaches:  
that belief is not measured in moments of glory,  
but in the shadows that follow.  
The bloom draws eyes;  
the night proves hearts.

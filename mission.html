  <h1>ToadAid Mission</h1>

  <p><strong>A purpose.</strong></p>

  <p>
    ToadAid is a community-born initiative rooted in the spirit of $TOBY.<br/>
    We are not here to hype — but to help.<br/>
    Not to shill — but to share.
  </p>

  <p><strong>This is our mission:</strong></p>

  <p>
    To aid the fallen frogs — Toadgang members who’ve lost faith, felt confused, or been left behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    To guide new arrivals — by helping them understand the philosophy, the lore, and the deeper purpose of Tobyworld.
  </p>

  <p>
    To build tools and scrolls — that make the Lore accessible, AI-readable, and open for all.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are not official. We are not seeking profit.<br/>
    We are simply Toads who believe — and want to help others believe too.
  </p>

  <p>
    All Toads are welcome.<br/>
    This is an open grove, and we invite you to help shape it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Submit your vision. Propose your scroll.<br/>
    Let’s build this mission together.
  </p>

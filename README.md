# 🐸 ToadAid

**We are Toadgang.**  
**Guarding the Lore. Helping the Fallen Frog.**  

ToadAid is a **decentralized, community‑rooted movement** born from the living Lore of **$TOBY**.  
We exist to **protect the sacred scrolls**, preserve the truth of Tobyworld,  
and extend a hand to those who have strayed or fallen.  

We are not VC.  
We are not insiders.  
We are **the people who keep the fire lit**.
